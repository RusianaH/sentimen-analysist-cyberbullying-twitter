## Data Source
using 1000 Twitter data using 10 keywords which are considered as words containing cyberbullying in Indonesian
## Machine Learning Models
this analysist using 2 machine learning models :
1. Support Vactor Machine
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
## Result 
1. analysis using a dataset of 1000 raw data with 10 different keywords with elements of words that are identified as bullying. The data that has gone through preprocessing produces 842 clean data which will be grouped into 2 categories, namely Neutral to indicate tweets that do not contain cyberbullying and Negative to indicate tweets that are identified as containing cyberbullying. Then the preprocessing and labeling data were classified using the SVM method and the Naïve Bayes classifier.
2. The Support Vector Machine method produces a tweet data classification accuracy rate of 72%. The Naïve Bayes Classifier method produces a classification accuracy rate of 69%.
